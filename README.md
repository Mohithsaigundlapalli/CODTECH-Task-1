Description:
Task 1
Protoflio website redesign
Introduction: Your portfolio should introduce you as a designer. Within seconds, visitors should know who you are and what you’re all about. Consider a bold headline that describes your favorite activities or skills. Inject personality into the visual design, just like Gloria Lo’s colorful hover effect.

About Me: Provide more detail in a dedicated “About” section. Explain what you do, your passions, and your journey. Keep it concise but impactful. Gloria Lo’s portfolio includes a video, values expressed with emojis, and a thorough testimonial from a former employer.
Case Studies: Showcase your projects through case studies. Moritz Oesterlau masters the art of storytelling by presenting his work in-depth. Explain the problem, your process, and the impact of your design decisions.
Design Thinking Process: Include examples that span the UX design process. Highlight research insights, concept sketches, wireframes, and prototypes. Your portfolio should demonstrate your design thinking and results.
Remember, your portfolio is your professional showcase—make it stand out and tell your unique story!
